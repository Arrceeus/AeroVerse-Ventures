            <h3>Aerodynamics</h3>
            <p>
              <h6>
              The study of the behavior of air around objects, including lift and drag. The term aerodynamics is often used synonymously with gas dynamics, the difference being that "gas dynamics" applies to the study of the motion of all gases, and is not limited to air.

            	<h3>Hypersonic Flight</h3>
            <p>
              <h6>
              Flight at speeds greater than five times the speed of sound. Hypersonic flight is governed by physics principles such as the stagnation point, high-temperature effects, low-density flow, thin shock layers, viscous interaction, and the entropy layer.

						<h3>Avionics </h3>
             <p>
              <h6>
              The electronic systems used in aircraft, including navigation, communication, and instrumentation.The cockpit of an aircraft is a typical location for avionic equipment, including control, monitoring, communication, navigation and anti-collision systems.

						<h3>Noise-Control</h3>
            <p>
              <h6>
               Basically it's about the strategies to reduce noise pollution generated by aircraft engines and operations. Aerodynamic noise arises from the airflow around the aircraft fuselage and control surfaces.

						<h3>Propulsion</h3>

           <p>
             <h6>
             It is a critical aspect of aeronautical engineering that focuses on the generation of thrust to propel aircraft and spacecraft through the air and space. It encompasses the design and operation of various propulsion systems, including jet engines, rocket engines, and propellers.

						<h3>UAVs</h3>
            <p>
              <h6>
                Full form of UAVs is Unmanned Aerial Vehicles. UAVs may be classified like any other aircraft, according to design configuration such as weight or engine type, maximum flight altitude, degree of operational autonomy, operational role, etc.
